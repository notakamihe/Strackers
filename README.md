# Strackers
JavaFX Desktop Application project that I worked on at Summit Technology Academy.

We manage many things subject to being lost. To solve this issue me and a couple others created Stackers. The idea of Strackers was to create a software that would manage physical stickers that could blend in with and be attached to any object. If an item needed to be found, the user could just look up the sticker's GPS location as well as flash a light or play a sound. This project is ONLY a software simulation of what were to happen if we had the physical resources (i.e. stickers, bluetooth, GPS, etc.)

This project was built with JavaFX as the UI, Java as the backend and SQL as the server.
